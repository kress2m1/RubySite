    <h1>Andre's Prog-Mine tech Story -h1</h1>
    <p>
    Andre's story began a long time ago, when <em><strong>Smaug</strong></em> reigned supreme
    over the skies of Adalon.<br>
    He was a <strong>great dragon</strong>, loved by none and feared by all.<br>
    One day, he sought the precious...<br>

    It was no where to be found, alas, unfortunately for the village of Smirch,<br>
    which lay directly over the flight path of Smaug when he flew from his cave to hunt for food <br>

      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"><strong>Tim
        Berners-Lee</strong>
      </a>.
      It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his
      cat, but it would be cool if it were!
